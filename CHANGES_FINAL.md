# Final Changes to Fix Issues

## 1. Fixed Model Selection Persistence

- Added code to properly save the selected model to the session and current chat when a POST request is made
- Ensured the model selection is saved to the chat data and persists between messages
- Added explicit save_chats() calls to ensure the model selection is saved to disk

## 2. Consolidated Duplicate Models in Dropdown

- Updated MODEL_DISPLAY_NAME_MAP to standardize all Llama 4 Maverick variants under a single display name
- Added additional variants of Llama 4 Maverick to ensure all versions are properly mapped
- Added standardization for Llama 3.3 70B models as well

## 3. Improved Provider Selection Logic

- Added explicit lists of models known to be supported by Cerebras and Groq
- Enhanced the provider selection logic to prioritize direct API providers (Cerebras, Groq) over g4f
- Added better model ID mapping for specific models like Llama 3.3 70B and Llama 4 Maverick
- Modified the Groq model validation check to allow for standardized model IDs
- Added clear logging when falling back to g4f providers as a last resort

## 4. Other Improvements

- Added more detailed error handling and logging
- Improved code organization and readability
- Added comments to explain the logic and decision-making process

These changes should address all the issues mentioned while maintaining the functionality of the application. The model selection should now persist correctly, duplicate models have been consolidated, and the provider selection logic has been improved to prioritize faster providers.# Final Changes to Fix Issues
